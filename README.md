# CIS project: Adverserial Interactive Learning


# Week 1:
- Literature Review
- Implement the [paper's](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.04847.pdf) code


# Week 2:
## Meeting summary:

1. Wrong plan, should think about my own game and use python to build the environment

2. Remember to be very clear about the whole paper, this should be the first priority

## Plan:
- [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.04847.pdf) flowchart
- Literature reviews and plan for proposal
- Implement the env
- Prepare slides
- Look at the robosuite
### Reading List:
 - Increasing Generality in Machine Learning through
Procedural Content Generation
 - Domain Adversarial Reinforcement Learning
 - Adversarial Robust Deep Reinforcement Learning Requires Redefining Robustness

# Week 3:
## Summary:
1. No meeting this week due to Wafa's conference travelling

## Plan:
- Finish the proposal
- Continue the implementation of the Environment
- Look deeper into the [robosuite](https://robosuite.ai/docs/overview.html)

# Week 4:
## Meeting summary:
1. Continue implemeting the Environment
    - Adding the interactive way 
    - Consider changing of the environment in terms of the generator's action

# Week 5:
## Meeting summary:
1. Change the way of applying "Interaction", for now, considering do it by swapping game difficulties
2. Creating a module diagram for different methods of interaction
